                                        When one meets old friends, he often engages in old sins and shenanigans. This
                                        can cause heedlessness. How does one navigate this when leaving friends isn’t an
                                        option?

                                        Leaving friends is an option—of course, it is! Why would it not be an option to
                                        leave friends who are distracting one from Allah (SWT)? It’s a no-brainer; there
                                        is no choice in the matter! <br> <br>
                                        It means some part of us enjoys that, enjoys that ghafla (heedlessness), that
                                        sin. That is the nafs! Enough dhikr is not being done to switch on the light,
                                        the Noor in the heart. <br> <br>
                                        When a person is perpetual in dhikr for weeks or months, they begin to feel a
                                        difference, because the heart is being polished. Rasool Allah (ﷺ) clearly stated
                                        in an authentic hadith that everything has a sublime polish, and the polish of
                                        the heart is the dhikr of Allah.<br> <br>
                                        The absence of dhikr is like a dark cloud upon the heart, leading to confusion
                                        in daily life, anxiety, and lack of clarity. In contrast, Allah says in the
                                        Qur’an: <b> ‘Verily, in the remembrance (dhikr) of Allah, hearts will find
                                            tranquillity.’ </b> <br> <br>
                                        So, if a person is being pulled in a certain direction—for example, some friends
                                        from university used to get together and commit certain sins, such as listening
                                        to music, dancing, etc.—once they reconnect, the old habits and environment
                                        resurface.<br> <br>
                                        Now, the brother or sister has progressed in their Deen and knows these actions
                                        do not please Allah (SWT). They understand that life requires far more value to
                                        be given to it than simply indulging in these fleeting distractions.
                                        Alhamdulillah, this person has moved on and matured spiritually, mentally, and
                                        emotionally. <br> <br>
                                        But when the old friends return, the memories are stirred, and the nafs begins
                                        to wake up. Even though the physical environment may not be the same, bringing
                                        back the same people from the past creates a similar atmosphere. <br> <br>
                                        A person should avoid such company because it is lethal!
                                        Our Hazrat Shaykh once said to us, “There is nothing more dangerous than the
                                        company of those who are not on the Deen.” A person is known by the company they
                                        keep, and that company inevitably has an effect.<br> <br>
                                        Some sisters, mashaAllah, Allah grants them the tawfeeq to take the great and
                                        courageous step—so beloved to Allah and His Rasool (ﷺ)—of wearing the hijab. May
                                        Allah reward them immensely, and indeed He does. May Allah protect them and
                                        grant them even more courage.<br> <br>
                                        Now, these sisters may have friends they used to know who don’t wear hijab. If
                                        the sister does not persist in dhikr, has not fully safeguarded her heart, and
                                        is not in touch with the pious (sufiah or mashaikh), then meeting up with those
                                        friends often leads to the same sort of conversations and interactions as
                                        before.<br> <br>
                                        Even if these friends never explicitly discourage the sister from wearing the
                                        hijab, she may still become weaker over time. Wallahi ul-Azeem, I have seen this
                                        happen too many times!<br> <br>
                                        Eventually, the sister either stops wearing the hijab entirely or begins to wear
                                        it in a different manner, such as leaving the neck exposed. That is not hijab;
                                        it is merely a partial head covering. Similarly, I have seen cases of brothers
                                        who were steadfast in their prayers but later regressed.<br> <br>
                                        No good Muslim will ever directly tell another to stop wearing hijab or to stop
                                        praying, but if they themselves don’t practice these acts, their company still
                                        has an effect—a metaphysical and spiritual effect. Slowly, it becomes harder for
                                        the person to even maintain the little they were already doing.<br> <br>
                                        This is precisely why Rasool Allah (ﷺ) said, <b>“Solitude is better than bad
                                            company, but good company is better than solitude.”</b><br> <br>
                                        Why is this the case? It is because company shapes a person’s behavior. For
                                        example, if everyone around you is engaging in sin, no one will question it. No
                                        one will ask, “Why are we backbiting? Why are we listening to this music?”
                                        Instead, it becomes normalized.<br> <br>
                                        When we keep the company of those who are indifferent or relaxed about these
                                        matters—not necessarily bad people, but those who have not truly appreciated the
                                        value of iman and the need to safeguard it—it inevitably affects us.<br> <br>
                                        And none understood this reality more than the Prophet (ﷺ).
                                        Some people say, “We don’t meet anyone, only occasionally.” But company is not
                                        limited to the people you physically meet or sit with. Company includes those
                                        you talk to on the phone, the people you stay in touch with on WhatsApp,
                                        Snapchat, Instagram, or other platforms. This type of communication also has an
                                        impact.<br> <br>
                                        This is why the opposite is also true! The one who maintains rabita (contact)
                                        with their shaykh or a pious person counteracts the day-to-day mingling with
                                        people who are relaxed about Deen or are non-Muslims.<br> <br>
                                        For example, think of a seesaw in a park where children play. Whichever side is
                                        heavier will go down, and the other side will go up. Similarly, if a person
                                        stays in touch with bad company, it will have an impact and tip the balance.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Even the books we read and the literature we consume have an effect. The human
                                        mind is truly amazing, but it absorbs a lot subliminally as well.<br> <br>
                                        So, leaving friends is not just an option; it is the option that the Prophet (ﷺ)
                                        wants us to adopt, because <b> solitude is better than bad company. </b> <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But why is good company better than solitude? Because even in solitude, we still
                                        have our mobile phones, and we can watch whatever we want. For example, we might
                                        think, "Oh, that’s just a PG-rated family film," or, "It’s just The Lion King, a
                                        harmless story playing in the background."
                                        The Lion King is not harmless! It is absolutely dangerous! I watched parts of
                                        The Lion King as part of my research. Did you know that in The Lion King itself,
                                        in one scene, the smoke that comes out from one of the animals spells out the
                                        word ‘sex’ in the clouds? This is how Disney corrupts our children.<br> <br>
                                        Then people wonder, “How did I get involved in this sin? My parents were good
                                        people.”<br> <br>
                                        The music we listen to has a profound impact. May Allah reward a Maulana from
                                        South Africa who, 20 years ago, showed us how backtracking and
                                        backmasking—playing a sound in reverse—revealed hidden messages in music. The
                                        human brain is truly amazing! If you want something to affect the subconscious
                                        or stay in memory, you must do it backwards or upside down. (I can elaborate on
                                        this in greater detail on another occasion.) Those familiar with
                                        neuro-linguistics will understand this concept.<br> <br>
                                        What music labels across all genres started doing is embedding messages or using
                                        specific frequencies that could cause disruptions to a person’s internal system
                                        or spirituality.<br> <br>
                                        A sister once sent me a video and asked if I could listen to it, as she said it
                                        helped her sleep. It was accompanied by a soothing picture and a certain sound
                                        at a specific frequency. When I listened, I could hear the name ‘Iblees’ being
                                        repeated. I asked her if she could also hear it. She said no.<br> <br>
                                        I then gave it to a friend who digitally decoded the sound. It revealed Iblees
                                        being repeated throughout the recording. It was played at such a frequency that
                                        she couldn’t consciously hear it, but her subconscious had become accustomed to
                                        it due to the darkness she had exposed herself to.<br> <br>
                                        This sister would have moments where she felt flashes of being close to Allah,
                                        but she would always go back to the music. She couldn’t leave it.<br> <br>
                                        Whether it is Disney, The Lion King, or other similar content, these things have
                                        an impact. Even something like WhatsApp can influence us, as we cannot always
                                        control what appears. Some people have differing WhatsApp statuses, messages, or
                                        images that affect us.<br> <br>
                                        In what way? For example, if non-Muslims are in our contact list and they post
                                        certain images or content, that can have a subtle but lasting impact on our
                                        hearts and minds.<br> <br>
                                        This is why having good company is essential for both brothers and sisters! Good
                                        company counteracts these negative influences. Without it, a person will never
                                        reach their full spiritual potential.<br> <br>
                                        Allah (SWT) has created the jinn and mankind for His worship. Worship means
                                        living a life in a way that pleases Allah. This includes how we eat, drink,
                                        speak, treat one another, fulfill our promises, and avoid speaking about others
                                        behind their backs—all in a way that aligns with Allah’s pleasure.<br> <br>
                                        We all know these things, but it takes time to implement them fully. This is
                                        where the one-on-one relationship between a student and their shaykh becomes so
                                        important. The student must be honest and consistent in their rabita
                                        (connection) with their shaykh.

                                        Sins should be hidden, so why should we tell our sins to our shaykh? It comes in
                                        a hadith of the Prophet (ﷺ) that Allah is displeased with the one who openly
                                        sins, especially when Allah has concealed their sins, and yet they openly tell

                                        This is indeed a true hadith and is mentioned in Sahih Muslim.<br> <br>
                                        However, this hadith refers to those who openly sin—the fujaar—and the act of
                                        fujoor is openly committing and speaking about sins. These are people who do not
                                        consider a sin to be a sin anymore.<br> <br>
                                        For example, someone may go to a nightclub and then proudly tell others that
                                        they went. Or, someone might watch something they shouldn’t have and then
                                        discuss it in intricate detail with others, as if there’s nothing wrong with it.
                                        They no longer see the sinfulness in their actions.<br> <br>
                                        The heart of such a person has become sick, and they are unable to see the harm
                                        they’ve caused to their Ruh (soul) because of their actions.<br> <br>
                                        But if you sit in the company of those who protect themselves from such things,
                                        you will notice the difference in how you feel spiritually. You will feel closer
                                        to Allah.<br> <br>
                                        This is why a true sign of a Wali Ullah (friend of Allah) is that when you are
                                        in their company, you feel closer to Allah. It doesn’t matter how big their
                                        turban is or how outwardly religious they seem; the essential part is whether
                                        they remind you of Allah.
                                        So, the hadith is speaking about fujaar—those who openly sin and take pride in
                                        such actions—not about the person who sins and seeks help or consultation in
                                        confidence with their shaykh or teacher.<br> <br>
                                        This was the way of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet ﷺ), who used to
                                        consult the Prophet (ﷺ) about their struggles. They would say, “I feel like a
                                        munafiq (hypocrite),” or, “I hate this person,” or, “I have anger,” or, “I used
                                        to help this person, but I don’t want to anymore.”<br> <br>
                                        In fact, one person came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and openly asked for permission to
                                        commit adultery. He revealed his inner struggle in front of the Prophet (ﷺ).
                                        These were simple people who loved Allah but also had a nafs (inner desires).
                                        They would openly admit their struggles and then have their tazkia (spiritual
                                        purification) done by the Prophet (ﷺ).<br> <br>
                                        The Prophet (ﷺ) responded to this man by asking, “Do you have a mother? Do you
                                        have a sister? Would you like if anyone did that to them?” He addressed the
                                        issue first through logic and reasoning, making the man reflect on the situation
                                        intellectually.<br> <br>
                                        Then, the Prophet (ﷺ) touched the man on his chest and made dua for him, and by
                                        the grace of Allah, the man was cured of his desire for this sin.<br> <br>

                                        Similarly, it is haram for both men and women to reveal their bodies, their satr
                                        (private parts) or awrah (areas that must be covered). However, all scholars
                                        agree that if there is a medical need, one may reveal that part of the body,
                                        even if it is to a doctor of the opposite gender.<br> <br>
                                        This is because the maqsood (objective) in such a situation is the cure, which
                                        takes precedence in cases of necessity.<br> <br>
                                        Similarly, when a person is involved in a certain sin, do they not know it is a
                                        sin? Why can’t they leave it? This is because it takes someone who is trained
                                        and experienced to help them overcome it.<br> <br>
                                        I often compare this to personal trainers in a gym. Who doesn’t already know
                                        that more steps, resistance training, or mobility exercises are good for them?
                                        Everyone knows these things! So why do people pay tens, hundreds, or even
                                        thousands of dollars for a personal trainer?<br> <br>
                                        It’s because someone who is external to you, who has specific motivations and
                                        goals to see you succeed, can guide you better. A personal trainer has likely
                                        gone through that journey themselves and understands the process to help others
                                        achieve their goals.<br> <br>
                                        This is, of course, a crude example, as there are limitations and poor examples
                                        in such fields.<br> <br>
                                        In spirituality, a shaykh is someone who has spent years—not just days or
                                        months—in the company of their own shaykh, undergoing a process of cleansing,
                                        purification, and guidance. This is done on a one-to-one, confidential
                                        basis.<br> <br>
                                        Just as there is doctor-patient confidentiality, there is shaykh-mureed
                                        confidentiality. In fact, even if two brothers or sisters from the same family
                                        are seeking guidance from the same shaykh, he is duty-bound to keep each
                                        person’s issues private. This confidentiality is an essential part of the
                                        shaykh's responsibility, and he is obligated to uphold it.

                                        self-indulgence and revolves around serving one’s desires without regard for
                                        others. It’s not a black-and-white matter; there is a spectrum.<br> <br>
                                        For example, arrogance also has a spectrum. You can easily spot it in some
                                        people—the way they hold their nose up, always comparing their car, their
                                        wealth, or their status. With others, it might not be as obvious; it might come
                                        out subtly. They might flash their watch in your face, and until you acknowledge
                                        or comment on it, they feel unfulfilled. It’s clear to see, arrogance has a
                                        spectrum.<br> <br>
                                        Similarly, selfishness has a spectrum. But self-preservation is entirely
                                        different. How so?<br> <br>
                                        Self-preservation means taking steps to ensure one doesn’t deteriorate
                                        physically, mentally, spiritually, or financially. If someone does things to
                                        mitigate these circumstances, they are not practicing selfishness and calling it
                                        love—they are simply preserving themselves.<br> <br>

                                        How do you know when to draw the line? It’s simple! When a person is
                                        self-preserving their finances—working hard and doing the good they can to
                                        provide for their family—that is perfectly fine. But when that focus starts
                                        having a negative impact, that’s when the line is crossed.<br> <br>
                                        For example, if one shift turns into two shifts, and their prayer (salah)
                                        becomes hasty or rushed, then it’s no longer about self-preservation. It has
                                        become self-indulgence because now the Deen is suffering.<br> <br>
                                        When the rights of the people around us are being infringed upon—whether it’s
                                        the rights of our wives, parents, children, siblings, relatives, friends, or
                                        neighbors—that is when we need to be concerned.<br> <br>
                                        Take the example of a husband and wife who are married. If the wife hasn’t had
                                        any one-on-one time with her husband—despite living together—she hasn’t
                                        experienced the quality time she would like to speak from her heart, confide in
                                        him, and connect with him physically, mentally, psychologically, and
                                        spiritually.<br> <br>
                                        But the husband is constantly involved in the work of the Deen, doing good
                                        actions. He may be helping people, running ten charities, benefiting thousands,
                                        giving sermons every day—his actions are apparently all for the benefit of
                                        others.<br> <br>
                                        But that supposed benefit to other people, while the wife is being neglected, is
                                        no good whatsoever. On the Day of Judgment, he won’t be asked, “Did you guide
                                        10,000 people in your street?” He will be asked about how he treated his
                                        wife.<br> <br>
                                        She left her home to move in with you; with just two words, she became your
                                        wife! Now, when she needs you, when you are supposed to be her greatest
                                        confidant, you are absent—because you are busy “helping the world.” This is how
                                        shaitan deceives us, making us neglect those closest to us in the name of doing
                                        good for others.<br> <br>
                                        And this works vice versa for women as well. Often, sisters say to me, “I spend
                                        all day with my children, and I am exhausted.” Of course, parenting is
                                        exhausting. Motherhood is exhausting. But it is also extremely rewarding.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Because motherhood is so exhausting, fatiguing, and draining in so many ways,
                                        that is precisely why the mother has a rank that the father does not have.
                                        Allahu Akbar! How beautiful is Allah’s religion!<br> <br>
                                        Jannah (Paradise) lies at the feet of the mother, and the father is the gateway
                                        to it, according to the Prophet (ﷺ). This means we must serve them both
                                        well.<br> <br>
                                        When a wife tells me, “I am doing all of this—raising children, helping my
                                        parents or in-laws, running the house, and managing countless other tasks,” I
                                        remind her of the immense value of her role. A sister once called me for advice,
                                        and I asked her, “What does your mother do?” She responded, “Housewife.”<br>
                                        <br>
                                        I told her, “Never say that.” But at the same time, that doesn’t mean replacing
                                        it with terms like “homemaker,” which some people use mockingly or without
                                        understanding the depth of its meaning.<br> <br>
                                        What’s important to understand is that building a home is not a boring or
                                        mundane task. It is vital to the welfare of humanity. Without strong, robust,
                                        resilient, and courageous women as wives and mothers (InshaAllah), this
                                        essential foundation cannot be fulfilled by men alone.<br> <br>
                                        Of course, people manage when Allah tests them, and they have no choice. But the
                                        ideal, the way Allah has designed it, is that both roles are crucial and
                                        complementary.<br> <br>
                                        None understood this better than the Prophet (ﷺ). When he was born, his father
                                        had already passed away, and his mother passed away when he was just six years
                                        old. But he was the Prophet of Allah—he had the angels, and Jibreel (AS) would
                                        come to him with divine guidance.<br> <br>
                                        So, when sisters say, “We don’t have time to do dhikr or anything else,” I ask
                                        them, “Do you make time for your husband?” If they respond, “He’s busy working,”
                                        I then ask, “Do you ask for time or make time?” Because this is very important,
                                        and it works both ways in a relationship.<br> <br>
                                        This brings us back to the point about self-prioritization. It is not
                                        selfishness—it exists on a spectrum. That is the first thing to remember. What I
                                        would call self-prioritization is really self-preservation.<br> <br>
                                        For example, if a person is working on themselves and ensuring their spiritual,
                                        emotional, and physical well-being, they are preserving themselves. If they
                                        haven’t worked on themselves, they are of no real benefit to society. We may
                                        think we are helping others, but without personal balance, we are likely falling
                                        short.<br> <br>
                                        The best way to remember this is through the first hadith recorded by Imam
                                        Bukhari: <b>“Verily, actions are based on intention.”</b><br> <br>
                                        Our entire tariqa (spiritual path), all of these relationships, and this effort
                                        we make are for no monetary gain. The goal is to draw closer to Allah and His
                                        Rasool (ﷺ). The essence of this tariqa is to inculcate ikhlas (sincerity), to
                                        develop a state where we do everything solely for the sake of Allah.<br> <br>
                                        If we are helping the whole world but lack sincerity in it, then what is it
                                        worth? Sometimes, a person may think they have sincerity, but in reality, they
                                        are only doing it to make themselves feel good. This, too, is problematic—haram
                                        in the context of tariqa (though not in shariah), because it is for ghair Allah
                                        (something other than Allah).<br> <br>
                                        A person should not worship Allah just for the feeling it gives them, because in
                                        that case, they are worshipping the feeling itself, not Allah. What does a
                                        servant have to do with feelings? A servant’s duty is to worship Allah,
                                        regardless of how they feel.<br> <br>
                                        Yes, it is good to have an emotional attachment, but just like in a marriage,
                                        when a husband and wife are initially married, there is a lot of excitement and
                                        attraction. Over time, that raw love and excitement transform into a deeper,
                                        more profound love.<br> <br>
                                        Many people, particularly in Western psychology and counseling, say that couples
                                        get bored of each other as time goes on. That may be true for them, but for a
                                        practicing Muslim man or woman, the love should only deepen over time. Why?
                                        Because they have done acts of service for one another over a prolonged period,
                                        inshaAllah.<br> <br>
                                        Through years of earning credit with one another—sacrificing time, space, money,
                                        and resources, supporting one another during difficult times, and building
                                        something together—the relationship becomes more meaningful. It’s no longer
                                        about fleeting emotions but about an enduring connection.<br> <br>
                                        At this stage, it’s not that the love is gone; it’s that the love has become
                                        deeper. And because it has become deeper, you don’t always notice the "leaves
                                        shaking all the time," if that makes sense.<br> <br>
                                        SubhanAllah! How beautifully has Rasool Allah (ﷺ) explained this. The Prophet
                                        (ﷺ) said—and I am paraphrasing the hadith.<br> <br>
                                        The example of a believer and a hypocrite is beautifully explained by the
                                        Prophet (ﷺ):<br> <br>
                                        The hypocrite is like a tall, sturdy-looking tree. When the wind blows, it
                                        doesn’t seem to move much. On the other hand, the believer is like the date palm
                                        tree, which sways and bends when the wind blows, giving the impression that it
                                        is weak. But the reality is quite the opposite!<br> <br>
                                        When a strong windstorm comes, the oak tree—stiff and unyielding—is uprooted,
                                        while the date palm tree, though it bends, remains firmly rooted and is never
                                        uprooted.<br> <br>
                                        This is the example of a Momin (believing man or woman). A believer may go
                                        through countless difficulties in life—whether with health, wealth, finances,
                                        marriage, divorce, children, friends, or other trials. We all face the loss of
                                        loved ones, death, regrets, and various challenges, but a true believer will
                                        never lose their iman!<br> <br>
                                        A Momin is never uprooted because they have sabr (patience) and salah (prayer).
                                        They have Allah (SWT), who says: <b> “I am with you when no one else is with
                                            you.”</b> <br> <br>
                                        This is the feeling we want people to hold onto—the deep, unshakable belief that
                                        no matter what happens, Allah (SWT) is always with them.<br> <br>
                                        It takes time to truly develop sincerity (ikhlas) and to understand who will
                                        guide you along the way. While this may not directly answer the exact question,
                                        it’s important to expand on this to cover various related aspects.<br> <br>
                                        If a person goes out helping the whole world but lacks sincerity, their actions
                                        are ultimately of no value in the sight of Allah.<br> <br>
                                        The Prophet (ﷺ) warned us of this in a profound hadith. The first three people
                                        who will be dragged to Jahannam by their faces are:<br> <br>
                                        1. <b>An aalim (scholar) </b>who didn’t practice what they preached.<br>
                                        2. <b>A shaheed (martyr)</b>who fought and died on the battlefield, but only so
                                        people
                                        would call him brave.<br>
                                        3. <b>A person who donated extensively</b>, but only so people would call him
                                        generous.<br> <br>
                                        We could do great deeds in the world and claim that we are prioritizing other
                                        people, but if we do not prioritize ourselves first, we are missing the
                                        fundamental command that Allah has given us. Allah (SWT) says: <b>“Save
                                            yourselves
                                            from the Fire, and your families…”</b><br> <br>
                                        This means our first priority is to save ourselves—our iman, our connection with
                                        Allah—and then to care for and guide our families.
                                        I gave the example of a person who gives duroos (lessons), runs charities, or
                                        engages in other noble acts, yet neglects their family. This is not the balance
                                        that Islam teaches.<br> <br>
                                        Everything should be done at its appointed time. When it is family time, that
                                        time should be sacred (not in the divine sense, but in its importance). A
                                        person’s phone should be switched off, and full attention should be given to
                                        their family. That is their time, and it should be respected and protected.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Similarly, things are eating into our families, whether it’s the phone or
                                        tablets. Parents have stopped parenting; they just hand the tablet to their
                                        children and say, “Watch this and that.”<br> <br>
                                        I’ve had to research some of the content relatives give to our children out of
                                        love. We’ve seen how Disney and TV manipulate our children with subliminal
                                        messaging. <br> <br>
                                        And it can lead to selfishness—that is why a person needs a shaykh. You can
                                        never work on yourself too much. <br><br>
                                        It is not selfishness if one is working on themselves. It is selfishness,
                                        however, if a person does something that is not related to their spiritual
                                        elevation and enhancement. If a person is striving to better themselves in the
                                        Deen and undergoing tazkia (spiritual purification), this is not selfishness.
                                        They are working to rid themselves of blameworthy actions that Allah does not
                                        want them to have, such as ego, vanity, or exaggeration (which is a form of
                                        lying).<br><br>
                                        It depends on what you mean by putting oneself first. If a person only cares
                                        about what they are eating and ignores whether others are eating, that is
                                        undoubtedly selfish.<br><br>
                                        The final example I want to give is that of an airplane. Flight attendants and
                                        stewards explain the emergency protocols, one of which is: “In times of
                                        emergency, air masks will drop down. First, put it on yourself, and then help
                                        others.” This aligns with Allah’s command: <b>“Save yourselves from the Fire
                                            first.”</b>

                                        It is very easy to become despondent and fall into despair. A person might
                                        think, MashaAllah, I am practicing the Deen, but I am so insincere and bad that
                                        nothing will be accepted. <br> <br>
                                        This is exactly how shaitan tries to attack those who are practicing. He doesn’t
                                        leave you alone—ever! So, he uses different whispers to mislead you.<br> <br>
                                        He whispers, You are a show-off, and as a result, the person might leave their
                                        dhikr or even stop praying altogether. They convince themselves, I’m not doing
                                        this because I am sincere; I’m only doing it to show off.
                                        However, the reality is that when you leave the deed, that is when you are
                                        claiming to be "holy." By leaving it, you are essentially saying, MashaAllah,
                                        look at me—I’ve stopped doing this deed so that no one can accuse me of showing
                                        off. This is yet another deception of shaitan.<br> <br>
                                        But when a person shares these feelings with their shaykh, the shaykh reassures
                                        them: Don’t worry, you are not showing off; continue to worship. <b> These are
                                            just
                                            whispers of shaitan.</b><br> <br>
                                        Because the mureed has love for their shaykh and trusts and has confidence in
                                        him, they listen to his advice. The shaykh also makes dua for the mureed, which
                                        provides spiritual support and encouragement.<br> <br>
                                        The shaykh advises the mureed to focus on their ibadah and avoid seeking out
                                        places where people might watch them. However, if they happen to find themselves
                                        in such situations, the shaykh tells them: Don’t focus on the people; focus on
                                        Allah.<br> <br>
                                        Additionally, the shaykh may suggest learning the translations of the words
                                        being recited in prayer and worship. This helps deepen concentration and
                                        connection with Allah.

                                        Tasfiyah (purification) refers to the purification of the heart (qalb), while
                                        tazkia is the purification of the nafs (soul) and its desires.<br> <br>
                                        Although desires are also present in the heart, their roots are in the nafs.
                                        That is why the work begins with the heart—because the heart is the master key
                                        to unlocking the soul. The goal is to instill and remind the heart of its love
                                        for Allah.<br> <br>
                                        As the hadith explains, it is the parents who shape the child’s initial beliefs,
                                        making them Hindu, Christian, Communist, or otherwise. But the heart has a
                                        natural inclination toward Allah that can be reawakened.<br> <br>
                                        As for Jazb, it is not the same as jazba (enthusiasm). Jazb literally means “to
                                        absorb.” It is the process of absorbing the love of Allah. It is not just an
                                        abstract or intangible concept; through dhikr, a celestial light is created in
                                        the ruh (soul).<br> <br>
                                        When you begin to experience this purification and connection, you are able to
                                        recalibrate yourself. Brothers and sisters often tell me, “Wow, I have never
                                        looked at myself this way before. I am able to analyse why I am making certain
                                        decisions and mistakes, and I am becoming a better husband, brother, sister,
                                        mother, son, daughter, or wife.”<br> <br>
                                        Why is this happening? It is because Allah is also giving them extra assistance.
                                        Allah (SWT) says: <b>“You take one step toward Me, and I will take many steps
                                            toward you. You come a palm’s length toward Me, and I will come an arm’s
                                            length
                                            toward you. You come walking toward Me, and I will come running toward
                                            you.”<br> <br>
                                            Allah just wants us to try!</b><br> <br>
                                        Jazb is the feeling of love you have for Allah, which can sometimes make it
                                        difficult to listen to the advice of a shaykh or to take difficult decisions
                                        that you don’t want to face.
